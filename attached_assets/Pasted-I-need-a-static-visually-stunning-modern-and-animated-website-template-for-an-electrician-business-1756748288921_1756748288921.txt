I need a static visually stunning, modern, and animated website template for an electrician business called "Riakona Electrical Solutions and Projects". The website must grab attention immediately with impactful visuals, professional animations, and a bold design that represents power, reliability, and innovation.

Here are the sections that must be included:

Home Page / Hero Section:

A full-screen hero banner with animated electrical effects (e.g., subtle sparks, glowing lines, or animated wiring visuals).

Business name: "Riakona Electrical Solutions and Projects"

Tagline: “We do everything Electrical – from installations to fault finding.”

CTA buttons: “Get a Quote” and “View Our Work”

About Us Section:

Brief, compelling intro:
“Riakona Electrical Solutions and Projects provides a wide range of electrical services to fit your needs. We specialize in domestic and residential maintenance, fault finding, and installations.”

Services Section:

Grid layout with animated icons or hover effects

Services:

Domestic Electrical Work

Residential Maintenance

Fault Finding & Repairs

New Installations

Compliance Certificates

Emergency Call-Outs

Past Projects Section:

Image gallery or project cards with hover animations or lightbox effect

Brief descriptions, project locations, and outcomes

Customer Reviews Section:

Carousel or fade-in testimonial layout

Include 3–5 example reviews with star ratings and client names

Contact Page / Section:

Clean and responsive contact form with name, email, phone, and message fields

Optional map (showing service area)

Contact details block with phone, email, and operating hours

Sticky navigation with animated scroll behavior

Animations: Smooth fade-ins, parallax sections, button hover effects, subtle electrical-themed transitions

Color palette: Use bold, high-contrast colors (deep blue, white, yellow/orange for accents) to reflect energy and professionalism

Mobile-responsive and accessible

Make the code easy to edit and structured in components if using a framework like React or Next.js. Ensure assets and styles are organized. Use placeholder text/images where needed.

The website must be fully static, only html, css and js.
